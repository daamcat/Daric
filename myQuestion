Here is the problem:

If in DaricSolution.pro I add:
DaricLib.depends = dropboxQt

I get qmake error:
:-1: error: No rule to make target 'dropboxQt-qmake_all', needed by 'sub-DaricLib-qmake_all'.  Stop.

If I comment it out, qmake builds without complaining. But I can not build the project. When I try to build the project, I receive the following error:
MainWindow.cpp:-1: error: undefined reference to `dropboxQt::DropboxAuthInfo::DropboxAuthInfo()'

I know that this error means that I have not linked against the library properly. But I don't know why. What is wrong with my linking?
